The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results when multiple selectors target the same element.  For example, a more specific selector might unintentionally override a more general selector that was intended to apply.

```css
/* Intended style */
p { color: blue; }

/* Unintended override due to higher specificity */
#my-paragraph p { color: red; }
```

In this case, even if `#my-paragraph` is only applied to one paragraph element, its higher specificity means the red color will be applied to all `<p>` elements nested within `#my-paragraph`, potentially breaking the intended blue styling for paragraphs elsewhere.
